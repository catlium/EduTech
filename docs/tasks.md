# Task Tracker

## Priority Revision (2026-08-19)

Development priority shifted to the **AI-Assisted Learning and Examination
Management System**. The multi-tenant foundation remains, but SaaS management
features are **deferred** until the main system foundation is functional.

System priority order:

1. Academic Structure
2. Content / Study Foundation
3. OCR Pipeline
4. AI Processing
5. Question Bank
6. Examination
7. Checking System: FORM (online), OMR (answer sheets), OSM (on-screen marking)
